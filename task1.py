#question 1(assigned by Golden): 
#Create a console application that collects age from a user. Display the age collected.
#To take this some steps further, please consider the following:

# 1) Ensure the user inputs a number (You should be able to convert the input to an integer)
# 2) Keep asking for the user's input till the user inputs a number
# 3) The asking should be done 10 times after which an error should be thrown telling the user that a number is what is expected
# 4) if the user is not up to 10 years, display: you're too young.
# 5) If the user is between 10 and 15 years, display: you're a still young
# 6) If the user is between 16 and 20 years, display: you're mid-aged
# 7) If the user is more than 20 but not up to 30 years, display: you're fairly young
# 8) If the user's age is not covered here, display: we couldn't find a good match for you

# Goodluck guysðŸ˜Š
